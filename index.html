          <p><span class="opener">Chuck Yeager</span> began his career during World War II, flying as a P-51 fighter pilot in the US Army Air Forces. After the war, he held commands around the world, but Yeager is best known for his record-breaking work as a test pilot. On October 14, 1947, US Air Force Capt. Chuck Yeager flew a Bell X-1 experimental plane at Mach 1 some 40,000 feet over the Mojave Desert, becoming the first human to travel faster than the speed of sound.</p>

          <p>The Bell X-1 is a rocket engine–powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), Army Air Forces supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly 1,000 miles per hour in 1948.</p>

              <h2>The Sound Barrier</h2>
              <p>The sound barrier or sonic barrier is the sudden increase in aerodynamic drag and other undesirable effects experienced by an aircraft or other object when it approaches the speed of sound. When aircraft first began to be able to reach close to the speed of sound, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making faster speeds very difficult or potentially impossible.</p>
